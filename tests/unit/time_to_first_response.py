"""A module for measuring the time it takes to get the first response to a GitHub issue.

This module provides functions for measuring the time it takes to get the first response
to a GitHub issue, as well as calculating the average time to first response for a list
of issues.

Functions:
    measure_time_to_first_response(
        issue: Union[github3.issues.Issue, None],
        discussion: Union[dict, None]
    ) -> Union[timedelta, None]:
        Measure the time to first response for a single issue or a discussion.
    get_average_time_to_first_response(
        issues: List[IssueWithMetrics]
    ) -> Union[timedelta, None]:
        Calculate the average time to first response for a list of issues with metrics.
