"""A module containing unit tests for the time_to_first_response module.

This module contains unit tests for the measure_time_to_first_response and
get_average_time_to_first_response functions in the time_to_first_response module.
The tests use mock GitHub issues and comments to test the functions' behavior.

Classes:
    TestMeasureTimeToFirstResponse: A class to test the measure_time_to_first_response function.
    TestGetAverageTimeToFirstResponse: A class to test the
        get_average_time_to_first_response function.
